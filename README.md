**Project Scope:**

The Telegram Bot provides a platform for individuals or groups to have reminders of their to-do list. The design of the reminders will be customizable such that students can choose the type of reminders they want. 

Example Options for reminders:
<br />
Group: `Group reminder for a project deadline`
<br />
Module: `Reminder for a specific module’s assignment` 
<br />
CCA: `Customizable reminders for CCA activities`
<br />
Social gatherings/activities: `Customizable reminders of meetup details` 
<br />
Snooze : `“snooze” options when a reminder pops up to allow users to delay their tasks at hand for 10 minutes, while making sure that they will receive another reminder in the future so that the task will not be forgotten.`
<br />

A prototype of our Telegram Bot is available for testing so feel free to try it out and give us your comments. 
<br />


Do take note that the bot is hosted on a cloud server that sleeps after 30min of inactivity so you may need to wait up to a few minutes for the bot to wake up after calling /start. Also, the server may time out sometimes and you will have to wait for a while, then re-enter either /start or /help to continue using the bot.
Also, do remember to add the Telegram Bot to the group you wish to test it in.
